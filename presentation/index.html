# Configuration Management using Puppet
Taste me you will see, more is all you need

My presentation was supposed to be about puppet...

# Configuration Management using Chef
Automate what is automatable, and make automatable what is not so.

???

... so chef it is.

If you want to remember something from this presentation:
Mindset over tools!

- Motivation

<br/><br/>

- Software Configuration Management

<br/><br/>

- Infrastructure as Code

<br/><br/>

- Tools (Chef, etc)

<br/><br/>

- Demo

]

???

We'll start with discussing about why this is relevant for us around this table.

We'll continue discussing software configuration management in general.

After that I just need a slide about infrastructure as code.

We'll quickly mention a few tools which can do the job, before we take a deeper look at Chef...

... with a demo at the end.

  ## Motivation

- Test environments

<br/><br/>

- Apply software development techniques we know and use in our regular work

]

???

Our (currently) biggest paint point is our test environments.

 - They take long time to set up
 - Still logging on to _each_ server
 - Setup is error-prone
 - Due to our IT-regime, we hang on to our servers as if life depended upon it.
   We don't let go until long after the server is dead.

We are software developers in charge of environments. We should apply software
development techniques we know to this job:

 - Test driven development
 - Version control
 - Continious delivery
 - Our infrastructure as code
 
How this can be done is fortunatly a solved problem.

Introducing Software Configuration Management:

# Software Configuration Management

???

Several words is used for this topic.

Sofrware Configuration Management has an abbreviation which crashes with source control management, which is unfortunate.

Personally I use configuration management a lot, since, well - the only thing we do here at work is software.

## Software Configuration Management is:

.blockquote[
  [...]software configuration management [...] is the task of tracking and controlling changes in the software[...]
] 
]

???
According to Wikipedia:
SCM is the task of tracking and controlling changes in the software.

Kinda vague, yet not too alien.

We kinda do this with our software already - all the way to our chocolatey/nuget feeds.

But after we've created our software, things kinda stops. There are three things we are missing:

 - Easy way to provision servers.
 
 - Easy way to deploy our apps.
 
The latter can be included in the former. For the latter, I suggest we use Octopus Deploy. For the former, SCM can be a solution.

## Software Configuration Management includes:

 - Version control
 
 - Build and release management
 
 - Tracking and monitoring changes
 
]

???
In order to achieve this we need to have:

Version control.
 - We currently use git as our version control system.
 
A working buildsystem.
 - We already have a new buildsystem written in scriptcs which can be run on any(tm) buildserver (teamcity, tfs, travis, jenkins, you name it) used by the rest of the code.
 - This is achievable.
 
Release management:
 - For the rest of the code, we produce chocolatey and nuget packages, and have a strict versioning regime based on semantic versioning. We build CI, RC and stable packages.
 - This is achievable.
 
Tracking and monitoring changes:
 - We are currently able to do this using the previously mentioned points for the rest of our code.
 - No reason we should not be able to do this for our infrastructure.

- Environment management
]
]

???

What may be a bit alien to us (for now) is:

Deployment:
 - We do not have a working solution for deploying our packages to the 500-ish servers we have for test.
 
Environment management:
 - We also do most environment management manually (with the exception of cloning existing VMs and some few templates with obscure names).
 - We deeply care about or servers, because it took us time to make them work. What if those steps could be reproduced through code?

Software configuration management includes all these steps to achieve their goals.

## Software Configuration Management solves

 - Configuration control/Environment management

 - Reduce redundant work
 
 - Avoid configuration-related problems
 
 - Defect tracking

]

???

SCM solves some of the following problems we have:

 - It gives us full control over what runs where. Have we installed the latest server-component? What version of the .NET framework is installed? What about IIS-addons, etc?
 
 - We need to do the hard work of configuring once, and can re-use that configuration, or create configuration based on the previous configuration. Using known development features like inheritance(!).
 
 - We avoid configuration errors made by users, like "oh, i have configured Oracle12C wrong", or "My appserver is running against the wrong database".
 
 - We can track errors in configuration systematically instead of qualified guesses.

# Infrastructure as code

???

Just a short mention of IaC. Most has been mentioned already.

## Infrastructure as Code

 - Uses higher level language
 - Most tools are idempotent
 - Apply:
   - Version control
   - Design patterns
   - TDD
 - Scales better than traditional management
]

???

- Most IaC is written in higher level language of some sort.

- Most tools are idempotent - can apply changes many times resulting in same outcome.

- Can apply software engineering techniques to our infrastructure:
  - Version control
  - Design patterns
  - TDD
  
- Scales better than traditional management.

# Tools

So which tools can we use for this?

Lots of tools to choose from.

We got a mail from puppet labs last year, but dont think we responded.

Common denominator:
 - Not written in C#/.NET
 
Some examples of syntaxes following:

## Example syntax - Ansible:

```ansible
--- 
- hosts: server
  sudo: yes
  sudo_user: root

  tasks:

  - name: install mysql-server
    apt: name=mysql-server state=present update_cache=yes

  - name: install ansible dependencies
    apt: name=python-mysqldb state=present

  - name: Ensure mysql is running 
    service: name=mysql state=started
```
]
???
Ansible.

Very similar to yaml.

  when "centos","redhat","fedora","suse"
    package_name "httpd"
  when "debian","ubuntu"
    package_name "apache2"
  when "arch"
    package_name "apache"
  end
  action :install
end
```

Chef is ruby. Kinda.

## Chef - overview:

???

Server:
Takes care of configuring all the nodes.
Two ways to go:
  - Hosted chef
    - Full hosted (SaaS)
    - Easy
    - No maint
    - Limited customization
    - No control over access speed
  - Chef server
    - On premise
    - Complex install
    - Requires maint
    - Fully customizable
    - Enables rapid deployment
    
Nodes:
Client nodes, like our application servers, databases, solr indexes, etc.

Chef SDK:
Development kit used on your own PC.

Management console: Gui

Edit something:
admin.rb

user 'Spud' do
  comment 'An awesome dips admin user'
  uid '1337'
  group 'chef'
  home '/home/spud'
  shell '/bin/bash'
  password 'fugleskremsel'
end

remember metadata
knife cookbook upload demo-linux
knife role from file .\demo-linux.rb

on server:
sudo chef-client
tail /etc/passwd -n 1
sudo su Spud
