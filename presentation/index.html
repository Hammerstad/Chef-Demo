Our (currently) biggest paint point is our test environments.

 - They take long time to set up
 - Setup is error-prone
 - Due to our IT-regime, we hang on to our servers as if life depended upon it.
   We don't let go until long after the server is dead.

We are software developers in charge of environments. We should apply software
development techniques we know to this job:

 - Test driven development
 - Our infrastructure as code
 
This is a solved problem.
